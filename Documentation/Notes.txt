-Vircurex has changed method of displaying site.
-ExtractedVircurexJS.js is the extracted js that injects the buy/sell/recent data&html into the page. Could learn a few things from it, along the lines of how to utilize the api (could utilize this info on another site).
-Utilize the newly extracted html files for buy/sell/recent tables in order to continue business as usual.

Will have to change:
vircurex.cellvalue (change the targets to the new targets found in the above files).
vircurex.getCellLocation (change the targets to the new targets found in the above files - could maybe remove right/maintop/timecell? Go through script to see if these are utilized elsewhere? yeah..).
